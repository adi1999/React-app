My name's Aditya Dhookia, did my graduation from IIT BHU and  I've been a part of treasury for last 2 years since my joining,

1. Starting off with my rotation 1, we got a POC on Saturn Uploader, where we had to redesign the application into microservices architecture
and build new UI as well. So, first I had to understand the existing flow of Uploader, then, I was responsible for the whole UI part, and I also conbtributed to backend services like server side pagination,
and implementation of template validation rules.

2. After that, I shifted to Big Data Space and working on the same from past 1.5 years.
I'll highlight some of my major contributions to saturn plaform.
First, I designed and implemented data upload functionality on saturn V3, and we can also apply custom validations on the data.
The time taken for 100k  records to persist and the changes to be reflected on UI is around 20 seconds. This functionality 
is quite modular and can be used by any team.

3. Moving on, I built pipelines for data processing, where I designed and implemented quite complex and dynamic logic as per business requirements
for filtering and enrichment of data. Here, I provided the functionality to change any number of fields and their values for conditions via a configuration
table.

4. Then, I also introduced a way to generate multiple reports with different LRD's from a single execution.


5. Coming to optimisation Part,
Here's a traditional flow which we follow in saturn for making pipelines, initially, we were also doing the same and 
it was taking arnd 38 mins for the whole processing.
to optimise that, I designed and implemented a pipeline the I removed all the redundant I/O operations which typically are time consuming
and now it's taking arnd 5 mins, I've also included the flexibility for optional persist of data at CDL level.

This kind of design can be used by other teams too while implementing their pipeline.



6. So these are contributions are the one which I did on my own, I've also done some other work with my team, which includes
We introduced a way to include hadoop tables for validation in Saturn Uploader.
We implemented a functionality to populate the approver's name as well as the file name while persisting the data in HDFS.



7. Apart from Saturn, I'm actively involved in other projects,

The first one which is currently being used by PACE department.
Just to give you a backgrond, I did a couple of research interships with international AI groups, 
and before joining DB, I was part of BSOCH AI self driving car group as an intern.
To utilise my AI/ML knowledge here, 
I designed and implemented the whole ML part of tool, it extracts all 
 the important information from resume, and it can match CV with a particular Job using ML.
 
 8. At present, I'm part of project cassiopeia with 20% sprint capacity,
 
 Where I'm involved in development of smart contract on ethererum blockchain for bond issuance, at present, we've developed and deployed the first contract, and we're giving this bond for auditing to external agency, once we have clearance, DB will issue bonds in germany by parterning up with cashlink.
 
 As the first contract development is done, we're developing a platform for all the web3 applications. For example, suppose investor asks us to issue a bond, 
 so he gotta pay in euros, we'll have to develop a mechanism that can inform the blockchain that payment part is done and the smart contract will get executed. 
 
 
 
 
To summarise, I've shared how I've been contributing to the company in technology and how I can help with other things too. Considering all of this, I believe I'm a great fit for the Associate role. Let's work together to bring more innovation and success to our company. Thank you!









Aditya upskilled and established himself as a full stack developer, and also completed 2 GCP trainings.

1. Designed and implemented a modular upload functionality for saturn v3 platform which 
also inlcludes custom validations can be easily used by other teams.
2. Proposed and implemented dynamic and complex logic for
data filtering and allocation for business requirement through a unique method.
3. Optimized processing time to just 5 mins using a innovative design, which can be used for future use by other teams.
Designed and implemented various solutions for unique business requirement.


Aditya is also part of project cassiopeia with 20% sprint capacity, Where he's involved in development of smart contract on ethererum blockchain for bond issuance,
and also building platform for a Web3 ecosystem for DB.
